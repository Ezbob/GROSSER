# GROSSER
Yet another Groovy sat solver? Well, this one is even more GROSSER than the last one since it's a parallel solver!

As with the GROSS solver, it's build using Groovy and Gradle so to find out what you can do with it just type in
`./gradlew tasks` (or use the batch script if you're on Windows).

Get solvin' !
